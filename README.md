# Credit-Card-Default-Mini-Project
This repo contains the project code for analyzing the default rate of credit card clients in Taiwan, which can be accessed on the UCI database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).
Started from making various assumptions in data cleaning, I tried to use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks in R to predict the credit card default rate.
